 1.Why Python?applications of Python?What are the key features of Python?

#   Python is a dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language.
#   It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural oriented programming.
#   In Python, we don't need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language.

### Applications of Python ###

# web applications
# Business application
# scientific applications
# Games Developement
# Audio abd vedio Applications
# CAD applicatin
# Desktop GUI
# data science and data visualization
# ML and AI

### key Features in python ###
# Easy to read and understand
# Free and open sources
# GUI Programming Support
# Interpreted Language
# Dynamically Typed Language
# Object-Oriented Language

2.Python is an interpreted language explain? How is Python an interpreted language?How do we interpret Python?
# An interpreter is a kind of program that executes other programs.
# When you write Python programs,convert source code into machine code by line by line.


3.What do you mean by Python literals?
# Literals in Python is defined as the raw data assigned to variables or constants while programming.
  We mainly have five types of literals which includes string literals, numeric literals,
  boolean literals, literal collections and a special literal None.


4.What type of language is python?
# python is dynamic type language.In Python we are not required to declare type for variables.
  Whenever we are assigning the value, based on value, type will be allocated automatically.
  Hence Python is considered as dynamically typed language.


5.What is the namespace in Python?
# A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information
  about the object that each name references.
# You can think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are the
  object names and the values are the objects themselves.


6.What are local variables and global variables in Python?
# Local Variables:
  Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable.
  This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space.
  If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function's body.

# Global variable:
  Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable.
  To make a variable globally, we need to declare it by using global keyword.

7.List the common built-in datatypes in Python?
# Built-in Data Types in Python
  1.python numbers: int , float, complex
  2.python list
  3.python tuple
  4.python set
  5.python dictionary
  6.python string
  7.Boolen Type:  True or False


8.Explain all the keywords in Python?
# The keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings.
# Value Keywords: True, False, None.
  Operator Keywords: and, or, not, in, is.
  Control Flow Keywords: if, elif, else.
  Iteration Keywords: for, while, break, continue, else.
  Structure Keywords: def, class, with, as, pass, lambda.
  Returning Keywords: return, yield.
  Import Keywords: import, from, as.



9.What are comments and how can you add comments in Python?
# A comment in Python starts with the hash character, # , and extends to the end of the physical line.
# A comment can be written in three ways - entirely on its own line, next to a statement of code,
  and as a multi-line comment block.

  Single-Line Comments
# Such a comment starts with a hash character (#), and is followed by text that contains further explanations.

   Multi-Line Comments
#  This multi line comment can be represented as """ """

10.How to check the Python Version in CMD?
#  python --version

11. How is memory managed in Python?
# Python uses the dynamic memory allocation which is managed by the Heap data structure.
# Memory Heap holds the objects and other data structures that will be used in the program.
# We use the Heap for implement dynamic memory management. We can use the memory throughout the program.

12. how the variable assignment happens in python a=10
# Variables store information that can be used and/or changed in your program.
  This information can be an integer, text, collection, etc.
